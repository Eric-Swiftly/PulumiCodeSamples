# Pulumi Code Samples

## Samples of python Pulumi code that others might find useful

My company is using Pulumi for infrastructure automation.  In some cases we tried to do things that we expected that others had already done.  If I could not find an example then I created it.  When I feel others may benefit from this work, I'll put things here.  It likely won't be well organized and is subject to change over time.

As a general rule files will be formatted with [yapf](https://github.com/google/yapf) with pep8 style and column_limit = 150.  It will usually be linted using pylint with the included .pylintrc.  A score of 10 is not guaranteed but easily fixed issues are usually taken care of.
